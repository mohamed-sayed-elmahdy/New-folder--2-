        <p className={styles.whatIsBlockParagraph}>
          Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process
          of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
          An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible
          (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually
          anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network,
          reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

            you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you

                networks.
